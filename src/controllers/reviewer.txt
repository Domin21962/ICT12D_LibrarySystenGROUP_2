### **1. Overview of Your Library System**  
ðŸ“Œ **Your answer:**  
*"Library System is used for searching and finding a book for the students' own purpose."*  

âœ… **Improved answer:**  
*"Our Library Management System is designed to help students efficiently search for and locate books within the library. Instead of manually searching through shelves, students can use our system to find books based on title, author, or genre. It also manages book borrowing, returning, and user records to ensure smooth library operations."*

### **2. Technologies Used & Why**  
ðŸ“Œ **Your answer:**  
*"We used Java, Apache NetBeans, and XAMPP. We chose Java because it is easy to use and required for our course. Apache NetBeans is our preferred IDE as it simplifies development. XAMPP is used to create and manage our MySQL database for storing user and book data."*  

âœ… **Improved answer:**  
*"We developed the system using Java with Apache NetBeans as our IDE and MySQL via XAMPP for database management. Java was chosen because of its strong Object-Oriented features and cross-platform compatibility. NetBeans provides built-in tools that simplify UI design and database integration. XAMPP allows us to manage MySQL easily and store user records, book details, and borrowing transactions securely."*

### **3. Who are the Main Users & How Does It Benefit Them?**  
ðŸ“Œ **Your answer:**  
*"The main users of our system are students, so they donâ€™t have to go to the library to find the books theyâ€™re looking for."*  

âœ… **Improved answer:**  
*"The primary users of our system are students and librarians. Students benefit by easily searching for books by title, author, or genre, reducing the time spent looking for books manually. Librarians can efficiently manage book borrowing, track overdue books, and update records without paperwork."*

### **4. Main Features of the System**  
ðŸ“Œ **Your answer:**  
*"The main feature of our system is ensuring that user data is securely stored. It also allows users to search for books by genre, author, or title."*  

âœ… **Improved answer:**  
*"Our system includes the following key features:  
1. **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration system.  
2. **Book Search:** Users can search for books by title, author, or genre.  
3. **Borrow & Return System:** Tracks which books are borrowed, by whom, and their due dates.  
4. **Overdue Management:** Notifies users about overdue books and penalties.  
5. **User Management:** Stores user data securely with authentication protocols."*

### **5. Challenges Faced & How You Solved Them**  
ðŸ“Œ **Your answer:**  
*"I faced a lot of problems ensuring that the database was properly connected to the system. I solved it by fixing my errors and watching YouTube tutorials."*  

âœ… **Improved answer:**  
*"One of the biggest challenges was connecting our Java application to the MySQL database. At first, we encountered errors such as `ClassNotFoundException` and `SQLException`. To solve these, we ensured the **JDBC driver** was properly configured and debugged our connection settings. We also referred to online resources and tutorials to understand best practices for database integration."*

### **6. How Did You Design Your Database Schema?**  
ðŸ“Œ **Your answer:** _(Not provided)_  

âœ… **Suggested answer:**  
*"Our database consists of multiple tables, including:  
- **Users Table** (stores user information such as ID, name, email, password)  
- **Books Table** (stores book details like title, author, genre, availability)  
- **Transactions Table** (tracks borrowed and returned books with timestamps)  

Each table is connected using primary and foreign keys to ensure data integrity."*

### **7. How Do You Handle User Authentication & Security?**  
ðŸ“Œ **Your answer:** _(Not provided)_  

âœ… **Suggested answer:**  
*"We implemented a login system using **JDBC with MySQL** to verify user credentials securely. Passwords are stored using **hashing techniques** to prevent direct access. The system also includes input validation to prevent unauthorized access."*  

---

### **8. How Did You Prevent SQL Injection & Other Security Threats?**  
ðŸ“Œ **Your answer:** _(Not provided)_  

âœ… **Suggested answer:**  
*"We used **Prepared Statements** in JDBC to prevent SQL Injection attacks. Instead of directly inserting user input into SQL queries, we use placeholders (`?`) to ensure that input is treated as data, not code. Additionally, we perform **input validation** and **escape special characters** to enhance security."*

### **9. How Do You Track Book Borrowing & Returning?**  
ðŸ“Œ **Your answer:** _(Not provided)_  

âœ… **Suggested answer:**  
*"We maintain a **Transactions Table** in our database, where each borrow or return event is recorded with details such as:  
- User ID  
- Book ID  
- Borrow Date  
- Due Date  
- Return Date  

When a book is borrowed, its status is marked as 'Unavailable' in the Books Table. When returned, the status is updated back to 'Available'."*

### **10. How Does Your System Handle Overdue Books & Penalties?**  
ðŸ“Œ **Your answer:** _(Not provided)_  

âœ… **Suggested answer:**  
*"Our system automatically checks due dates and flags overdue books. If a book is overdue, the system:  
1. Sends a notification to the user.  
2. Updates their account with a penalty (if applicable).  
3. Prevents further borrowing until the overdue book is returned."*
